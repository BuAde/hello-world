# hello-world
A short note to commence my introduction to github.

The main reason why I am here is because I use GMT to create sexy plots and maps. As GMT has been relocated to github so it is a good reason that I need to have a github account. I am teaching seismology for undergraduate geophysics students. I might use Github to facilitate my teaching. Hopefully this will push forward my github learning curve.
